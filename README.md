# SpeakAndSummarize: Call Centre Speech-to-Text & LLM Summarizer
##Overview
A call center customer text summarizer is an app designed to condense and extract the most important information from customer interactions in call centers. It automatically analyzes and summarizes the text-based conversations between call center agents and customers, providing a concise overview of the key points, issues, and resolutions discussed during the call. 
##Objective
To help call center supervisors and agents quickly understand the context of a customer's query or concern and improve response times and service quality.

#Methodology
Combined speech recognition and Hugging Face's language models to build applications that transcribed spoken content and summarized it for easy analysis and information retrieval.This opens up a wide range of possibilities for creating intelligent and efficient voice-based applications.

Speech Recognition:
**Utilized Python libraries like SpeechRecognition and pydub to capture and transcribe call centre customer audio.
Processed audio inputs from microphones or audio files.
Implemented speech-to-text capabilities to convert spoken words into text data.**

Hugging Face Algorithms:
**Hugging Face's "t5-small" model is used to load, fine-tune, and perform customer text summarization.**
