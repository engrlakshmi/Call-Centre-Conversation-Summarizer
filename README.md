# SpeakAndSummarize: Call Centre Speech-to-Text & LLM Summarizer
Combined speech recognition and Hugging Face's language models to build applications that transcribed spoken content and summarized it for easy analysis and information retrieval.This opens up a wide range of possibilities for creating intelligent and efficient voice-based applications.

Speech Recognition:
**Utilized Python libraries like SpeechRecognition and pydub to capture and transcribe call centre customer audio.
Processed audio inputs from microphones or audio files.
Implemented speech-to-text capabilities to convert spoken words into text data.**

Hugging Face Algorithms:
**Hugging Face's "t5-small" model is used to load, fine-tune, and perform customer text summarization.**
